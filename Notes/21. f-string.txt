-- Python f-strings provide a quick way to interpolate and format strings.
-- Theyâ€™re readable, concise, and less prone to error than traditional string interpolation and formatting tools, such as the 
   .format() method and the modulo operator (%).
-- An f-string is also a bit faster than those tools!
